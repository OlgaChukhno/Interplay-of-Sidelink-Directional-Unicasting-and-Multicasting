# Interplay-of-Sidelink-Directional-Unicasting-and-Multicasting

Simulation codes **the closed-form solution and its validation for the number of users involved in a mission-critical situation**.

We aim to investigate the possible interplay of sidelink communications, directional unicast transmissions, and multicasting. 
To this end, we offer a practical methodology based on a fluid model approximation to capture the time dynamics of mission-critical services in their transient phase.
